## About

'RobotControl.h' and 'RobotControl.cpp' implement control algorithms for a 6-degree of freedom robotic arm based on the open source robotic arm by Skyentific. The control algorithms are tested in CoppeliaSim using a kinematic model through 'simRobot.cpp'

The C++ client connects to CoppeliaSim through the [ZeroMQ remote API](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/zmqRemoteApiOverview.htm).
